# Simple Interview Questions
Hello recruiter or future employer! 


Jackie here - if you're reading this, welcome to my tiny WORK IN PROGRESS repository with some various small-scale code snippets, mostly serving as a showcase of some basic coding abilities on common interview questions common in the software development industry*. All of this is **my own code** by design, please note the use of readable code, efficiency, industry-standard commenting, and proper design practices. 


These projects are primarily in:
  - C++
  - Python



*\*These are generic interview questions. Any and all questions/projects showcased here are not knowingly taken from any specific company or set of interview questions.*
