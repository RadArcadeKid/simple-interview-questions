# RecruitersLookHere
Hi recruiter or future employer! 
This is a repository full of various small-scale code snippets and projects, mostly serving as a showcase of my coding abilities on basic interview questions common in the software development industry*. All of this is **my own code** by design, please note the use of readable code, efficiency, industry-standard commenting, and proper design practices. 

These projects are primarily in:
  - C++
  - Python (3)


While these are my two primary languages, working some solutions in both serve as a basis for the fact that I know both OOP with both linter and compiled languages. Please that I am also familiar with other languages such as Javascript, Scala, YAML, HTML+CSS! I am willing, able, and excited to learn new programming languages, too. 




*\*These are generic interview questions. Any and all questions/projects showcased here is not knowingly taken from any specific company or set of interview questions.*
